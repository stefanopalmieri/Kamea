# Kamea

A structural decomposition of reflective computation into independent capabilities, witnessed by finite algebras and proved by universal theorems over algebraic varieties.

**Three capabilities. Three walls. Seven roles. Zero `sorry`.**

*A finite algebra can simulate itself without describing itself. It can describe itself without hosting itself. It can host itself without describing itself. No capability implies any other.*

Lambda calculus gave functions a foundation. Turing machines gave computation a foundation. Kamea separates three independent capabilities of reflective computation — self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting — and shows that no capability implies any other (proved by concrete counterexamples). A 16×16 Cayley table is the witness: a finite algebra that exercises all three.

## The Three Capabilities

Self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are three independent capabilities. No capability implies any other — proved by concrete finite counterexamples at every boundary and every diagonal. Each can be present or absent independently. Whether the axioms for each capability are *minimal* (whether fewer or different axioms could achieve the same structural effect) remains open.

| Capability | Axioms | What it gives | Independence |
|------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Self-simulating (S)** | Retraction pair (Q/E) | Computes own Cayley table. Partial application injectivity forced. | `[Lean]` `SelfSimulation.lean` — 4 universal theorems |
| **Self-describing (D)** | Kripke dichotomy | Three categories (zeros, classifiers, non-classifiers) with hard walls. Judgment cannot merge with computation. | Independent of S: N=8 the Countermodel `[Lean]`; independent of H: N=10 diagonal `[Lean]` |
| **Self-hosting (H)** | Compose + Inert | Evaluator internalized. Smith's tower terminates at 256 bytes. | Independent of D: N=10 DRM without Compose `[Lean]` |

**Full independence.** No capability implies any other:

| | S ⊬ D | D ⊬ H | H ⊬ D | S ⊬ H |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Counterexample** | N=8 (the Countermodel) | N=10 (no Compose) | N=10 (diagonal) | N=4 (`kripke4`) |
| **What it shows** | Self-simulates, no clean roles | Has Kripke, no Compose | Has Branch+Compose+Y, no Kripke | Has retraction pair, too small for H |
| **Proof** | `[Lean]` | `[Lean]` | `[Lean]` | `[Lean]` (trivial: H needs N≥10) |

A retraction magma can compute its own table without the Kripke wall: a concrete 8-element counterexample with mixed elements self-simulates perfectly. A retraction magma can have all evaluation machinery (Branch + Compose + Y) without the Kripke wall: a concrete 10-element counterexample has 4 mixed elements yet satisfies all machine axioms. The Kripke wall is not forced by computation — it is the axiom that organizes the algebra into coherent roles. An algebra can *evaluate* without *understanding itself as evaluating*.

(The dichotomy is named after Kripke's "Outline of a Theory of Truth" (1975), where a language that can express its own truth predicate partitions sentences into *grounded* (those that resolve to true or false) and *ungrounded* (those that don't). The finite analog: every non-zero element is either entirely truth-valued on the core or entirely non-truth-valued — grounded classifier or computational transformer, no mixing. The three-category decomposition {zeros, classifiers, non-classifiers} is the finite algebraic version of Kripke's {paradoxical, grounded-true/false, ungrounded}.)

The Ψ₁₆ᶠ table has all three capabilities at once. The demo below exercises all of them: the table computes itself (S), the Kripke wall gives elements interpretable roles (D), and the meta-circular evaluator runs within the algebra with no external machine (H).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefanopalmieri/Kamea.git && cd Kamea

python3 psi_lisp.py examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
# or: kamea-rs/target/release/kamea run examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
```

```
=== PSI REFLECTIVE TOWER (Defunctionalized CPS) ===
Layer 3: User programs (fib, fact)
Layer 2: CPS meta-circular evaluator (psi_metacircular.lisp)
Layer 1: Base evaluator (psi_lisp.py)
Layer 0: Cayley table (256 bytes)

--- Level 0: Computation (meta-evaluated) ---
Defining fib and computing fib(8)... 21
Defining fact and computing fact(10)... 3628800

--- Level 1: Ground Verification (Cayley table probes) ---
Absorber laws (TOP/BOT): ALL HOLD
Table health: ALL INVARIANTS HOLD

--- Level 2b: Continuation Chain Inspection ---
Reify inside (let ((x (reify))) x):
  Chain depth: 3
  Frame 0 tag = k-let-bind? YES
  Frame 1 tag = k-let-body? YES
  Frame 2 tag = k-id? YES

--- Level 2c: Continuation Modification (rewriting the future) ---
K-IF BRANCH SWAP — the definitive 3-Lisp demo:
  Without modification: (if 1 42 99) → 42
  With branch swap: (if 1 42 99) → 99
  CONFIRMED: Program rewrote its own if-branches.
```

A program that can inspect its own continuation — where the continuation is data built from algebraically verified atoms. The table it runs on has Lean-proved rigidity, discoverability, and actuality irreducibility. The Lisp it implements has five axiom-forced role categories, seven specialized roles justified by compositional expressiveness, and a Turing-complete term algebra.

Smith's 3-Lisp (1984) had the reflective tower but no ground. The levels went down forever — interpreter interpreting interpreter interpreting interpreter. There was no bottom. Each level's meaning depended on the level below, and there was no foundation. Boba's Tower terminates at a 16×16 Cayley table — 256 bytes whose algebraic properties are machine-checked. The program verifies the table before trusting the evaluator. There is nothing beneath the table to worry about. It IS the algebra, not an implementation of it.

The demo: a defunctionalized CPS meta-circular evaluator — Ψ-Lisp interpreting itself with inspectable continuations — computes fibonacci, verifies the Cayley table it runs on, then reifies its own continuation as walkable data, navigates to a pending `k-if` frame, swaps the then/else branches, reflects, and takes the opposite branch from what the source code says. The program rewrites its own future. Everything below — axioms, theorems, phenomenology — is context for understanding what you just saw.

```bash
python3 psi_repl.py                                        # interactive REPL
python3 examples/psi16_corrupted_host_demo.py               # watch one wizard heal another
cd kamea-rs && cargo run --release -- repl                   # Rust REPL (~25x faster)
cd kamea-rs && cargo run --release -- run \                  # Rust reflective tower
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
```

### Compiled Boba's Tower

```bash
python3 psi_transpile.py --target rust \
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp > /tmp/tower.rs
cp psi_runtime_f.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/tower /tmp/tower.rs
/tmp/tower    # 2.2 ms — same output, 20,000x faster
```

Boba's Tower — fibonacci, factorial, table verification, continuation reification, frame walking, branch swap — compiles to a single native binary. 2.2 ms compiled vs ~43 s interpreted. The 256-byte Cayley table is embedded in the binary and verified at runtime. Smith's tower had no ground, so it could never be compiled — each level depended on the level below. This one has a ground, so the compiler can bottom out.

### Compile to Native

```bash
# C backend
python3 psi_supercompile.py examples/psi_counter_known.psi > /tmp/opt.psi
python3 psi_transpile.py /tmp/opt.psi > /tmp/counter.c
gcc -O2 -I. -o /tmp/counter /tmp/counter.c
/tmp/counter                                               # native speed, zero table lookups

# Rust backend (self-hosted transpiler — works with either interpreter)
python3 psi_lisp.py --table=c examples/psi_transpile_test.lisp | sed '1d;$d' > /tmp/out.rs
# or: kamea-rs/target/release/kamea run examples/psi_transpile_test.lisp | sed '1d;$d' > /tmp/out.rs
cp psi_runtime.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/out /tmp/out.rs && /tmp/out               # 3 42 99 3 5 5

# Compile the reflective tower to native (meta-circular evaluator as compiled Rust)
python3 psi_transpile.py --target rust \
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp > /tmp/tower.rs
cp psi_runtime_f.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/tower /tmp/tower.rs && /tmp/tower
```

The transpiler handles both computational programs (arithmetic, recursion, branching, list operations) and metaprograms (programs that construct and manipulate source code as data). The reflective tower — a meta-circular evaluator that builds S-expressions, reifies continuations, and modifies its own control flow — compiles to a single native binary via `psi_transpile.py --target rust`. The compiled tower produces identical output to the interpreted tower in 2.2 ms (vs ~43 s interpreted), a ~20,000x speedup. The 256-byte Cayley table is embedded in the binary and verified at runtime. A compile-time symbol table maps each quoted symbol to a stable integer constant, matching the interpreter's `_symbol_to_term` encoding. See [`docs/transpiler_gaps.md`](docs/transpiler_gaps.md) for the implementation details.

## Why It Matters

The contribution is not "a small table implements Lisp." It is the **independence structure**: self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are three distinct capabilities, and no capability implies any other — proved by counterexample at every boundary and every diagonal. Nobody has separated them before.

Self-simulation (computing your own table) requires only a retraction pair. Self-description (having coherent roles — judgment distinct from computation) requires the Kripke dichotomy. Self-hosting (running the simulation without an external evaluator) requires composition and substrate. Each pair of capabilities is separated by a concrete finite counterexample: an N=8 non-dichotomic retraction magma self-simulates but has no clean roles (S without D); an N=10 dichotomic retraction magma has roles but no element satisfying Compose (D without H); an N=10 retraction magma has all evaluation machinery but 4 mixed elements violating the dichotomy (H without D). The Ψ₁₆ᶠ table has all three at once.

This matters because every reflective system — every runtime with a reflection API, every JIT compiler, every meta-circular evaluator — combines these three capabilities without distinguishing them. The Ψ framework separates them and shows what each one costs: a retraction pair (standard category theory), the Kripke wall (one architectural axiom), and machine internalization (two operational axioms). The three-category architecture and the walls between categories are proved universal (Lean theorems that hold for all models). The specific seven roles within that architecture — and their correspondence to McCarthy's Lisp primitives — are convergently recovered by multiple independent axiom systems but not proved to be the unique decomposition. Full analysis: [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md), [`docs/self_simulation_necessity.md`](docs/self_simulation_necessity.md). Categorical reconstruction: [`docs/categorical_reconstruction.md`](docs/categorical_reconstruction.md).

**Scope.** Kamea is not a new model of computation. It is a structural decomposition of reflective computation into independent capabilities, using finite algebra as a microscope — not proposing it as a replacement for lambda calculus. The core contribution is the independence structure: three capabilities, fully independent, with the Kripke wall as an epistemic (not computational) axiom and a two-layer axiom architecture separating capabilities (N=10) from organization (N=12). The 16×16 table, the compiled tower, Turing completeness, and performance benchmarks are the *artifact* — a witness demonstrating that all three capabilities can coexist in a single finite algebra. The artifact is impressive but the theorem is the point.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Did you just encode Lisp in a lookup table?** No. A lookup table stores data; this table *computes*. The computational primitives of Lisp — quote/eval, conditional, cons/car/cdr, recursion — fall out of three independent capability axioms (S, D, H) at N=10, the minimum possible size. Nobody axiomatized "there must be a pair constructor"; the pair structure falls out of branching + substrate interaction. The clean seven-role architecture that makes those primitives look like McCarthy's specific design requires additional organizational axioms (the structural ladder + coherence constraints), pushing the minimum to N=12. The axioms operate at two layers: the *capability layer* produces the computational ingredients, and the *organizational layer* arranges them into separated, interpretable roles. The three-category architecture (absorbers, classifiers, non-classifiers) with hard walls is proved universal — every dichotomic retract magma decomposes the same way. The specific seven roles within that architecture are convergently natural (recovered by 3/4 independent axiom systems) but not proved to be the unique decomposition.

**Are the axioms natural or engineered?** The retraction pair and extensionality are standard category theory. The Kripke dichotomy is one new property — and it is independent of self-simulation (proved by N=8 counterexample). The machine axioms (compose, inert) are the most "engineered" — they are the conscious choice to internalize the evaluator, independent of the Kripke dichotomy (proved by N=10 counterexamples). But they are also the most clearly justified: without them, you need an external machine, and Smith's tower doesn't terminate. The distinctness axiom (all role-bearing elements are different) is standard algebraic practice, independently justified by expressiveness analysis (49 vs 16 one-step compositions).

**What's the contribution?** Three things. (1) The independence result: self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are fully independent capabilities — no capability implies any other, proved by concrete finite counterexamples at every boundary (N=8, N=10). (2) Machine-checked proofs: 23 universal algebraic theorems (zero `decide`, zero `sorry`) from two independent sources — Kripke axioms and self-simulation. (3) A working artifact: a compiled reflective tower (2.2 ms native) where a program verifies its own algebraic substrate, reifies its continuation, and rewrites its own control flow.

## The Seven Roles

| Ψ | Lisp | Role | Source |
|---|------|------|--------|
| ⊤ | NIL | Empty / base case | S (retraction pair) |
| Q | QUOTE | Freeze a term (constructor) | S (retraction pair) |
| E | EVAL | Unwrap / interpret (destructor) | S (retraction pair) |
| ρ | COND | Conditional branch | D (Kripke wall) |
| g | CONS | Build a pair | H (machine: substrate) |
| f | CAR | First projection | D (Branch axiom) |
| η | CDR | Second projection | H (machine: Compose) |

The correspondence is structural (same role inventory) rather than semantic (the domains differ: Ψ operates on magma elements, Lisp on symbolic lists). S gives quote/eval. D gives the wall that separates judgment from transformation, enabling conditional dispatch. H gives composition and substrate, enabling pair construction and sequential evaluation. The roles fall out of the capabilities.

The structure is necessarily non-commutative: any magma with two distinct left-absorbers cannot be commutative (three-line Lean proof in [`NoCommutativity.lean`](Kamea/NoCommutativity.lean)).

**What is proved vs. what is convergent.** The *architecture* — three categories (absorbers, classifiers, non-classifiers) with hard walls between them — is a universal theorem: every finite dichotomic retract magma decomposes the same way (112 non-isomorphic models at N=4 all share the decomposition). The *specific seven roles* within that architecture are not proved to be the unique decomposition. They are, however, convergently natural: three independently motivated axiom systems (category-theoretic, game-theoretic, categorical topos) — none referencing Lisp or McCarthy — recover the identical 2-1-8-1 category distribution (2 absorbers, 1 tester, 8 encoders, 1 inert). A fourth system (information-theoretic) recovers the same categories and walls but a 2-1-9-0 distribution, missing inert because it lacks an axiom forcing substrate. Whether an alternative axiom set could produce a different functional decomposition within the same three categories — say, different primitives that are not quote/eval/cons/car/cdr/cond but achieve the same computational power — is open. The architecture is a theorem; the specific instantiation is convergent evidence, not a uniqueness proof.

Of the 45 pairwise distinctness requirements among the ten role-bearing elements, **35 are derived theorems** (32 from categorical axioms + 3 from Turing completeness). The remaining **10 are the nontriviality axiom** — as 0 ≠ 1 in a nontrivial ring. Full analysis: [`docs/forced_roles_theorem.md`](docs/forced_roles_theorem.md).

## Key Results

### Paper 1: The Independence Structure (self-contained)

55 theorems across 7 Lean files. Zero `sorry`. A reviewer does not need to look at the 16-element table, the Lisp implementation, or the reflective tower to evaluate the core claim. Those are supporting material and motivation, not load-bearing walls.

**The decomposition exists** ([`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`](Kamea/CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean), [`NoCommutativity.lean`](Kamea/NoCommutativity.lean)):
- Three-category decomposition: every element is a zero morphism, classifier, or non-classifier `[Lean, universal]`
- Kripke wall: classifier ∩ non-classifier = ∅ `[Lean, universal]`
- Retraction pair members are non-classifiers `[Lean, universal]`
- No right identity in any model `[Lean, universal]`
- Card ≥ 4 (tight); card ≥ 5 when sec ≠ ret (tight) `[Lean, universal]`
- Asymmetry: two distinct left-absorbers ⇒ non-commutative `[Lean, universal]`

**It's invariant** ([`Functoriality.lean`](Kamea/Functoriality.lean)):
- DRM isomorphisms preserve zeros, classifiers, and non-classifiers `[Lean, algebraic, no decide]`
- Combined: the three-category decomposition is a proved algebraic invariant `[Lean, algebraic]`

**Self-simulation forces injectivity** ([`SelfSimulation.lean`](Kamea/SelfSimulation.lean)):
- Partial application injectivity: the self-simulator cannot compress the encoding `[Lean, universal]`
- Encoding injectivity: Q-depth encoding is injective `[Lean, universal]`
- Row determination: equal partial applications ⇒ identical rows `[Lean, universal]`

**The three capabilities are independent** ([`Countermodel.lean`](Kamea/Countermodel.lean), [`Countermodels10.lean`](Kamea/Countermodels10.lean)):
- S ⊬ D: N=8 FRM with classifier that violates Kripke dichotomy `[Lean, by decide]`
- D ⊬ H: N=10 DRM satisfying Kripke where no element satisfies Compose `[Lean, by native_decide]`
- H ⊬ D: N=10 FRM with Branch+Compose+Y that violates Kripke `[Lean, by native_decide]`
- S ⊬ H: N=4 DRM (trivial — H needs N ≥ 10) `[Lean, by decide]`

**Tight bound** ([`Witness10.lean`](Kamea/Witness10.lean)):
- S+D+H coexist at N=10: concrete witness is both a DRM and has Branch+Compose+Inert+Y `[Lean, by native_decide]`
- N=10 is optimal: 10 distinct distinguished elements need N ≥ 10 (counting) `[trivial]`

### Paper 2: The Artifact (supporting material)

### Model-Specific Theorems (Ψ₁₆ᶠ Witness)

Proved for the specific 16-element table by `decide`/`native_decide`.

- Rigidity: every injective endomorphism is the identity `[Lean]`
- Discoverability: 4 probes identify all 16 elements `[Lean]`
- Actuality irreducibility: twin models agree on structure, disagree on classifier assignment `[Lean]`

  **What actuality irreducibility means.** Two Cayley tables can agree on every cell except the classifier's response to one element. Both satisfy all structural axioms. Both are valid models. But they disagree on judgment — one classifies a given element as "true," the other classifies it as "false."

  The theorem says: structure does not determine classification. Three ways to read this:

  - *Philosophically*: the table's structure is phenomenal; the classifier assignment is noumenal. What counts as "actual" is not recoverable from observed structure.
  - *Computationally*: a well-typed program can produce different runtime behavior depending on which twin model it runs on. The type system underdetermines execution.
  - *Informationally*: the table is a channel; the classifier is a message. The channel doesn't determine the message. Additional information is irreducible.

  The classifier isn't arbitrary — both twins satisfy the axioms. It's *independent*: not derivable from anything else in the structure.

- 35/45 role pairs forced distinct: 32 by categorical axioms + 3 by TC `[Lean + Empirical]`
- 83 operational theorems on the 16×16 table `[Lean]`

### SAT and Empirical Results

- Kripke wall: judgment cannot merge with any other role (τ: 9/9 UNSAT) `[SAT]`
- Substrate wall: inert cannot merge with any other role (g: 9/9 UNSAT) `[SAT]`
- TC forces 3 distinctions: Q≠E (lazy/eager), Q≠f (lazy/eager), f≠η (projection uniqueness) `[Empirical]`
- Reflective tower forces 0 additional distinctions: all 10 nontriviality pairs survive full tower `[Empirical]`
- Composition closure forces 0 additional distinctions: all 10 survive sub-magma requirement `[Empirical]`
- 10/45 distinctness pairs are independent of all tested derivation sources (nontriviality axiom), exhaustively characterized `[Empirical]`
- Turing completeness: 7 axiom-forced elements simulate 2CM `[Empirical]`
- Reflective tower: 3 levels, branch swap, grounded continuations `[Empirical]`
- Compilation: within 4x of native Rust via supercompile → C/Rust; compiled reflective tower in 2.2 ms (20,000x over interpreted) `[Empirical]`
- Compiled reflective tower: meta-circular evaluator + continuation reification + branch swap in a single native binary `[Empirical]`
- GC: 10M allocations in 4MB via MMTk `[Empirical]`
- Futamura: all 3 projections demonstrated, fixed-point verified `[Empirical]`
- Extension profiles: Ψ₁₆ᶠ (hardware) and Ψ₁₆ᶜ (software), same core theorems `[Empirical]`
- Self-simulation: universal self-simulator verified on both Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ (512/512 cells, same code) `[Empirical]`
- Self-simulation: role-aware self-simulator computes 60/256 cells from algebraic rules alone `[Empirical]`
- Kripke dichotomy independent of self-simulation: N=8 non-dichotomic retraction magma (the Countermodel) `[Lean: Countermodel.lean]`
- Machine boundary: composition independent of Kripke dichotomy — N=10 DRM without Compose `[Lean: Countermodels10.lean]`; substrate independent — N=10 DRM without Inert `[SAT]`
- Diagonal independence: Kripke dichotomy independent of internal composition — N=10 FRM with Branch+Compose+Y but 4 mixed elements `[Lean: Countermodels10.lean]`
- Capability coexistence: all three capabilities (S+D+H) coexist at N=10 — the minimum possible size (10 distinguished elements). Full axiom stack requires N=12 due to ladder + coherence axioms (`minimal_sdh_test.py`) `[SAT]`

## The Axiom System

What is the simplest finite structure that can identify its own components through its own operation?

The Ψ framework answers this by stacking axioms on a finite magma (N-element set with binary operation `dot`). Each axiom forces a specific capability — absorbers for boundaries, testers for judgment, encoders for synthesis, quote/eval for reflection, branching for control flow — until the structure is self-describing.

**Structural Ladder (L0–L8)** — forces the basic role architecture:

| Level | Name | What It Forces |
|-------|------|----------------|
| L0 | Absorber ⊤ | `∀x: 0·x = 0` |
| L1 | Absorber ⊥ | `∀x: 1·x = 1` |
| L2 | Extensionality | All rows distinct |
| L3 | Tester exists | At least one non-absorber has boolean outputs |
| L4 | Encoder exists | At least one element synthesizes (≥2 distinct non-boolean outputs) |
| L5 | No extra absorbers | Only ⊤ and ⊥ are absorbers |
| L6 | No extra testers | At most 2 testers among non-absorbers |
| L7 | Inert exists | At least one "substrate" element |
| L8 | Encoder separation | ≥2 encoders with distinct output sets |

**Operational Axioms** — force specific computational capabilities:

| Axiom | What It Forces |
|-------|----------------|
| **C (Kripke)** | Only testers can produce boolean outputs on non-absorbers |
| **D (Inert Propagation)** | Inert elements preserve non-absorber status |
| **PA (Power-Associativity)** | `(x·x)·x = x·(x·x)` for all x |
| **VV (Inert Self-Application)** | Inert self-application yields a tester or encoder |
| **QE (Quote/Eval)** | `E·(Q·x) = x` and `Q·(E·x) = x` on core — mutual inverses |
| **1-Inert** | Exactly 1 inert element |
| **E-Transparency** | `E·⊤ = ⊤` and `E·⊥ = ⊥` |
| **Branch** | `ρ·x = f·x` if `τ·x = ⊤`, else `ρ·x = g·x` — tester-mediated conditional |
| **Compose** | `η·x = ρ·(g·x)` — function composition through branch |
| **Y-Combinator** | `Y·ρ = ρ·(Y·ρ)`, with `Y·ρ ≥ 2` — fixed-point combinator |
| **Selection** | `η·ρ = τ` — composing then branching yields a judgment |

**Minimum sizes.** The axioms operate at two layers: the three capabilities (S, D, H) provide the computational primitives; the structural ladder (L3–L8) and coherence axioms (PA, Selection, VV, 1-Inert) organize those primitives into a clean role architecture.

| What | Min N | What it gives |
|------|-------|---------------|
| S+D+H (three capabilities alone) | **10** | Encoding, classification, evaluation — computationally complete but role structure unconstrained |
| + structural ladder (L3–L8) + PA + Selection | **12** | Clean 2-1-8-1 role architecture, seven separated roles, McCarthy correspondence |
| + IO + 8-state counter | **16** | Efficient counters, product encodings, the specific Ψ₁₆ᶠ witness |

The computational primitives of Lisp — quote/eval, conditional, cons/car/cdr, recursion — fall out of the three capability axioms alone at N=10. The clean seven-role architecture that makes those primitives look like McCarthy's specific design requires the additional organizational axioms and pushes the minimum to N=12. The gap between N=10 and N=12 is the cost of *legibility*: going from an algebra that works to one whose roles are cleanly separated and interpretable. Full details: [`docs/technical_overview.md`](docs/technical_overview.md).

The axioms have an equivalent categorical formulation using standard vocabulary: zero morphisms, retraction pairs, subobject classifiers, and the Kripke dichotomy. The categorical formulation and its universal theorems are in [`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`](Kamea/CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean) (minimal 5-element witness + 16 universal algebraic theorems), [`NoCommutativity.lean`](Kamea/NoCommutativity.lean) (asymmetry — 3 universal theorems), and [`CategoricalFoundation.lean`](Kamea/CategoricalFoundation.lean) (full 16-element structure with products, copairing, and fixed-point combinator). All use only standard algebraic concepts — no Ψ-specific vocabulary.

The axioms operate at two layers. The **capability layer** (retraction pair, Kripke dichotomy, Compose + Inert) provides the three independent computational capabilities (S, D, H) — no capability implies any other (counterexamples at N=8 and N=10), and all three coexist at N=10. The **organizational layer** (structural ladder L3–L8, PA, Selection, 1-Inert) forces the clean role architecture (2-1-8-1 distribution, seven separated roles) that produces the McCarthy correspondence — this pushes the minimum to N=12. The capabilities give you the ingredients; the organizational axioms give you the recipe. Full inevitability analysis: [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md).

## What Is Not Proved

- **Uniqueness of Ψ₁₆ᶠ.** The Cayley table is one model from the solution space. The axioms constrain roles and relationships but leave 192/256 cells free at N=16 (25.0% determination). Cell-by-cell freedom analysis (`ds_search/n16_freedom.py`) confirms: absorber rows fully fixed (32), counter/INC/DEC pinned (24), E-transparency + INC2 fix 6 E-cells, selection fixes η·ρ, Y fixed-point fixes Y·ρ. Scale: N=8 → 28.1%, N=12 → 18.8%, N=16 → 25.0% (increase from N=12 due to additional operational constraints).
- **Role uniqueness.** The three-category decomposition (absorbers, classifiers, non-classifiers) and the walls between them are proved universal — every dichotomic retract magma has them. The computational primitives of Lisp (quote/eval, conditional, cons/car/cdr, recursion) emerge from the three capability axioms alone at N=10 — the minimum possible size. But the clean separation into seven distinct roles with the specific 2-1-8-1 distribution requires the organizational axioms (ladder + coherence) and is not proved to be the unique decomposition. Three of four tested alternative axiom systems converge on the same role inventory, which is strong convergent evidence but not a uniqueness proof. An alternative axiom set might produce different primitives within the same three categories that achieve equivalent computational power. The architecture is inevitable; the specific instantiation is convergently natural but not proved unique. Whether the McCarthy correspondence is a deep structural necessity or one of several equivalent encodings remains the central open question.
- **Minimality from base axioms.** Abstract axiom limitation theorems show base DirectedDS axioms imply only `card ≥ 2` (tight). What forcing conditions derive the full structure from first principles remains open.
- **Self-modeling vs discriminability.** Empirical search shows nearly all rigid magmas are WL-1 discriminable without self-modeling — unique structural fingerprints suffice for identification. Self-modeling adds interpretability: elements don't just have unique fingerprints, they have roles (classifier, transformer, substrate) that make the algebra a computational system rather than a mere barcode. Whether interpretability is necessary for reflective computation, or merely convenient, is open.
- **Extension profile optimality.** Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ are two points in the extension design space. Whether either is optimal for its target — or whether better profiles exist — is unexplored. The methodology (SAT search with target-specific constraints) can find other profiles, but the space has not been systematically enumerated.
- **Distinctness: 78% derived, 22% axiomatic (fully characterized).** Of 45 pairwise distinctness requirements, 35 are derived: 32 from categorical axioms (Lean-proved on the witness, SAT-verified universally at N=12) and 3 from Turing completeness (lazy/eager and projection conflicts — no evaluator can resolve them). The remaining 10 (⊤=⊥, Q=ρ, Q=Y, E=f, E=ρ, E=Y, f=ρ, f=Y, ρ=Y, η=Y) have been exhaustively tested against categorical axioms, Turing completeness, composition closure, and the full reflective tower including continuation reification and branch swap. All 10 survive all tests. They are the nontriviality axiom — the analog of 0 ≠ 1 in a nontrivial ring. Merged-role algebras satisfying all other axioms exist, compute, and reflect; they are expressively but not computationally degenerate.
- **Capability independence (resolved).** All three capabilities are fully independent — no capability implies any other, established by concrete finite counterexamples at every boundary and diagonal. (1) **D is independent of S**: a concrete N=8 non-dichotomic retraction magma with mixed elements self-simulates perfectly — 64/64 cells correct. (2) **H is independent of D**: an N=10 retraction magma satisfies the Kripke dichotomy but no element can satisfy Compose; another N=10 DRM has no inert element. (3) **D is independent of H** (diagonal): an N=10 retraction magma has all evaluation machinery (Branch + Compose + Y) but 4 mixed elements violating the Kripke dichotomy — the algebra can evaluate but cannot classify coherently. The Kripke wall is not forced by computation — it is the axiom that organizes the algebra into coherent roles, an *epistemic* requirement independent of *computational* power. Whether the axioms for each capability are *minimal* (whether fewer or different axioms could achieve the same structural effect) remains open. See [`docs/self_simulation_necessity.md`](docs/self_simulation_necessity.md), [`docs/categorical_reconstruction.md`](docs/categorical_reconstruction.md).
- **No canonical object.** Ψ₁₆ᶠ is not initial, terminal, or otherwise universal in the category of Kripke magmas — 112 non-isomorphic models exist at N=4, and no homomorphisms exist from the minimal witnesses to Ψ₁₆ᶠ. The canonicity of the project's results lies at the theory level: the three-class decomposition is a **proved functorial invariant** — any DRM isomorphism preserves zeros, classifiers, and non-classifiers (algebraic proof in [`Functoriality.lean`](Kamea/Functoriality.lean), no `decide`). Whether a natural universal property characterizes Ψ₁₆ᶠ within the subvariety DRMag⁺ (with products, copairing, fixed points, and distinctness) remains open. See [`docs/categorical_canonicity.md`](docs/categorical_canonicity.md).
- **Categorical formalization (partially complete).** The Kripke wall layer is now Lean-formalized: `CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean` defines the minimal `DichotomicRetractMagma` structure (zero morphisms, retraction pair, Kripke dichotomy) and proves 16 universal theorems purely algebraically; `NoCommutativity.lean` adds 3 more (asymmetry). The full three-layer inevitability argument (categorical → distinctness → Ψ-specific) has Lean support for the categorical layer (Kripke wall, three-category decomposition, non-classifier membership, asymmetry) and the model-specific layer (rigidity, discoverability, forced distinctness on the 16-element witness). The intermediate distinctness layer — proving that the 13 non-forced pairs are independently justified by expressiveness — remains supported by SAT analysis, not Lean. See [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md).

## Related Work

Boba's Tower sits at one end of an architectural fork in reflective language design.

Smith's 3-Lisp (1984) introduced the reflective tower — an infinite chain of meta-interpreters, each interpreting the one below. Subsequent implementations (Black, Brown, Blond) added live meta-modification: `(set! base-eval ...)` changes how the running interpreter works. Amin and Rompf (POPL 2018) showed how to compile user programs *through* the tower via stage polymorphism, collapsing multiple interpretation levels into efficient generated code.

All of these systems use higher-order continuations — opaque closures that can be invoked and composed but not inspected. Boba's Tower uses defunctionalized continuations — tagged data structures that can be walked, inspected frame by frame, and modified field by field. This is the architectural fork, and it is forced by whether the tower terminates.

An infinite tower cannot be defunctionalized — there are infinitely many continuation types. A grounded tower must be — there is no closure to hide behind; the bottom is data. Therefore: grounded → finite continuation types → defunctionalization → transparency → the branch swap. And symmetrically: infinite → closures → opacity → live meta-modification. The transparency of our continuations and the opacity of theirs are consequences of the same design choice.

| System | Tower | Continuations | Headline result |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Smith (1984) | Infinite | — | Reflective tower concept |
| Black/Brown/Blond | Infinite | Opaque closures | Live `set! base-eval` |
| Amin & Rompf (POPL 2018) | Collapsible | Opaque closures | Compile through the tower |
| **Boba's Tower (Kamea)** | **Grounded (256 bytes)** | **Tagged data** | **Compile the tower itself** |

What they have that we don't: live meta-interpreter modification (`set! base-eval`), infinite tower levels, compilation under modified semantics. What we have that none of them do: walkable continuations (the branch swap), a compiled tower (2.2 ms native), formal verification (106+ Lean theorems, zero `sorry`), and runtime substrate verification. See [`docs/related_work.md`](docs/related_work.md) for the full comparison.

## Performance

Two benchmarks: counter arithmetic (fib + fact + power + gcd, all inputs known at call time) and N-Queens(8) (backtracking search with cons-cell lists, 92 solutions). Counter arithmetic is pure compute; nqueens stresses allocation and recursion.

**Counter arithmetic** (fib(8) + fib-iter(30) + fact(10) + power(2,10) + gcd(100,75), amortized per iteration):

| Implementation | Time/iter | vs Native Rust |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Native Rust** (LLVM -O) | 0.003 µs | 1x |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → C** (gcc -O2) | 0.01 µs | **~4x** |
| **Native Python** | 5 µs | ~1,700x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Rust interpreter)** | ~200 ms | ~70,000,000x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | ~2,000 ms | ~700,000,000x |

**N-Queens(8)** (backtracking with cons/car/cdr, per call):

| Implementation | Time/call | vs Native Rust |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Native Rust** (LLVM -O) | 47 µs | 1x |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → C** (gcc -O2) | 86 µs | **1.8x** |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → Rust** (LLVM -O) | 114 µs | **2.4x** |
| **Native Python** | 5.9 ms | 125x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Rust interpreter)** | 4.1 s | 87,000x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | 301 s | 6,400,000x |

Compiled Ψ-Lisp is within **4x of native Rust** on pure arithmetic and within **2x on nqueens(8)** — faster than native Python in both cases. The nqueens gap is smaller because the cons-cell arena (bump allocator, no GC) is competitive with Rust's `Vec` push/pop. The entire compilation pipeline is ~1,100 lines: a 312-line supercompiler, a 640-line transpiler, and a 121-line C runtime whose core is a 256-byte array. Full performance analysis and extension profile comparison: [`docs/technical_overview.md#10-performance`](docs/technical_overview.md#10-performance).

**Boba's Tower** (meta-circular evaluator: fib(8) + fact(10) + table verification + reify/reflect + branch swap):

| Implementation | Time | vs Compiled |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| **Compiled tower** (rustc -O) | 2.2 ms | 1x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | ~43 s | ~20,000x |

The compiled tower is not about benchmark speed — it's about having the meta-circular evaluator as compiled Rust with continuations as data, the Cayley table verified at runtime, and branch swap via continuation modification, all in a single native binary.

## Building

`lake build` compiles all Lean files — the categorical foundation (19 universal theorems from axioms in `CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean` + `NoCommutativity.lean`), the self-simulation foundation (4 universal theorems from definition in `SelfSimulation.lean`), and the Ψ-specific operational proofs (130+ theorems on the 16-element table in `Psi16*.lean`). Zero `decide` on universal theorems. Zero `sorry` across all files.

```bash
# Lean (requires Lean 4.28.0 / Mathlib v4.28.0)

# Rust interpreter (requires rustup — https://rustup.rs)
cd kamea-rs

# MMTk garbage collection stress test
cd kamea-rs
HEAP_MB=4 cargo run -p wispy-stress --release                  # 10M allocs in 4MB heap

# WASM browser debugger (requires wasm-pack — https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
cd kamea-rs/crates/psi-web
wasm-pack build --target web                                   # build WASM (124KB)
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory www                    # serve debugger UI
# → open http://localhost:8080
```

Lean proofs use two techniques: universal theorems (`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`, `PsiUniversalBounds.lean`) use pure algebraic reasoning — no `decide`, no `native_decide`. Model-specific theorems (`Psi16*.lean`, `Cat*.lean`) use `decide` or `native_decide`, appropriate and complete for finite carrier types with decidable equality. Zero `sorry` across all files.

All Ψ-Lisp test programs produce identical output across Python, compiled C, compiled Rust, Rust interpreter, and WASM.
