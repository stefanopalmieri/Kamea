# Kamea

A self-describing finite algebra that recovers McCarthy's Lisp primitives from axioms, with machine-checked proofs.

**Three levels. Three walls. Seven roles. Zero `sorry`.**

*Self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are three independent capabilities of reflective computation. Each requires its own irreducible axiom. Each boundary is inhabited by a concrete counterexample. A 16×16 Cayley table is the witness — all three at once, with machine-checked proofs.*

Lambda calculus gave functions a foundation. Turing machines gave computation a foundation. Kamea separates three independent capabilities of reflective computation — self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting — and shows each requires its own irreducible axiom. A 16×16 Cayley table is the witness: a finite algebra that exercises all three.

## The Three Levels

Self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are three independent capabilities. Each boundary is inhabited by a concrete counterexample. Each level adds one irreducible axiom (or axiom group).

| Level | What's added | What it gives | Evidence |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Self-simulating** | Retraction pair (Q/E) | Computes own Cayley table. Partial application injectivity forced. | `[Lean]` `SelfSimulation.lean` — 4 universal theorems; `[Empirical]` universal self-simulator verified on Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ |
| **Self-describing** | + Kripke dichotomy | Three categories (zeros, classifiers, non-classifiers) with hard walls. Judgment cannot merge with computation. | `[Lean]` `CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean` — 19 universal theorems; `[SAT]` Kripke independent of self-simulation (N=8 non-dichotomic magma self-simulates, 64/64 cells) |
| **Self-hosting** | + Compose + Inert | Evaluator internalized. Smith's tower terminates at 256 bytes. | `[SAT]` Compose and Inert independent of both self-simulation and self-description; `[Empirical]` compiled reflective tower in 2.2 ms |

**The boundaries are real.** A retraction magma can compute its own table without the Kripke wall — a concrete 8-element counterexample with mixed elements (rows having both boolean and non-boolean outputs on the core) self-simulates perfectly. The Kripke wall is not about computing the table; it is the architectural axiom that organizes the algebra into coherent roles. Composition and substrate are not about roles; they internalize the machine, eliminating the external evaluator that self-simulation requires.

The Ψ₁₆ᶠ table is all three levels at once. The demo below exercises all of them: the table computes itself (level 1), the Kripke wall gives elements interpretable roles (level 2), and the meta-circular evaluator runs within the algebra with no external machine (level 3).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefanopalmieri/Kamea.git && cd Kamea

python3 psi_lisp.py examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
# or: kamea-rs/target/release/kamea run examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
```

```
=== PSI REFLECTIVE TOWER (Defunctionalized CPS) ===
Layer 3: User programs (fib, fact)
Layer 2: CPS meta-circular evaluator (psi_metacircular.lisp)
Layer 1: Base evaluator (psi_lisp.py)
Layer 0: Cayley table (256 bytes)

--- Level 0: Computation (meta-evaluated) ---
Defining fib and computing fib(8)... 21
Defining fact and computing fact(10)... 3628800

--- Level 1: Ground Verification (Cayley table probes) ---
Absorber laws (TOP/BOT): ALL HOLD
Table health: ALL INVARIANTS HOLD

--- Level 2b: Continuation Chain Inspection ---
Reify inside (let ((x (reify))) x):
  Chain depth: 3
  Frame 0 tag = k-let-bind? YES
  Frame 1 tag = k-let-body? YES
  Frame 2 tag = k-id? YES

--- Level 2c: Continuation Modification (rewriting the future) ---
K-IF BRANCH SWAP — the definitive 3-Lisp demo:
  Without modification: (if 1 42 99) → 42
  With branch swap: (if 1 42 99) → 99
  CONFIRMED: Program rewrote its own if-branches.
```

A program that can inspect its own continuation — where the continuation is data built from algebraically verified atoms. The table it runs on has Lean-proved rigidity, discoverability, and actuality irreducibility. The Lisp it implements has five axiom-forced role categories, seven specialized roles justified by compositional expressiveness, and a Turing-complete term algebra.

Smith's 3-Lisp (1984) had the reflective tower but no ground. The levels went down forever — interpreter interpreting interpreter interpreting interpreter. There was no bottom. Each level's meaning depended on the level below, and there was no foundation. Boba's Tower terminates at a 16×16 Cayley table — 256 bytes whose algebraic properties are machine-checked. The program verifies the table before trusting the evaluator. There is nothing beneath the table to worry about. It IS the algebra, not an implementation of it.

The demo: a defunctionalized CPS meta-circular evaluator — Ψ-Lisp interpreting itself with inspectable continuations — computes fibonacci, verifies the Cayley table it runs on, then reifies its own continuation as walkable data, navigates to a pending `k-if` frame, swaps the then/else branches, reflects, and takes the opposite branch from what the source code says. The program rewrites its own future. Everything below — axioms, theorems, phenomenology — is context for understanding what you just saw.

```bash
python3 psi_repl.py                                        # interactive REPL
python3 examples/psi16_corrupted_host_demo.py               # watch one wizard heal another
cd kamea-rs && cargo run --release -- repl                   # Rust REPL (~25x faster)
cd kamea-rs && cargo run --release -- run \                  # Rust reflective tower
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp
```

### Compiled Boba's Tower

```bash
python3 psi_transpile.py --target rust \
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp > /tmp/tower.rs
cp psi_runtime_f.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/tower /tmp/tower.rs
/tmp/tower    # 2.2 ms — same output, 20,000x faster
```

Boba's Tower — fibonacci, factorial, table verification, continuation reification, frame walking, branch swap — compiles to a single native binary. 2.2 ms compiled vs ~43 s interpreted. The 256-byte Cayley table is embedded in the binary and verified at runtime. Smith's tower had no ground, so it could never be compiled — each level depended on the level below. This one has a ground, so the compiler can bottom out.

### Compile to Native

```bash
# C backend
python3 psi_supercompile.py examples/psi_counter_known.psi > /tmp/opt.psi
python3 psi_transpile.py /tmp/opt.psi > /tmp/counter.c
gcc -O2 -I. -o /tmp/counter /tmp/counter.c
/tmp/counter                                               # native speed, zero table lookups

# Rust backend (self-hosted transpiler — works with either interpreter)
python3 psi_lisp.py --table=c examples/psi_transpile_test.lisp | sed '1d;$d' > /tmp/out.rs
# or: kamea-rs/target/release/kamea run examples/psi_transpile_test.lisp | sed '1d;$d' > /tmp/out.rs
cp psi_runtime.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/out /tmp/out.rs && /tmp/out               # 3 42 99 3 5 5

# Compile the reflective tower to native (meta-circular evaluator as compiled Rust)
python3 psi_transpile.py --target rust \
  examples/psi_metacircular.lisp examples/psi_reflective_tower.lisp > /tmp/tower.rs
cp psi_runtime_f.rs /tmp/
rustc -O -o /tmp/tower /tmp/tower.rs && /tmp/tower
```

The transpiler handles both computational programs (arithmetic, recursion, branching, list operations) and metaprograms (programs that construct and manipulate source code as data). The reflective tower — a meta-circular evaluator that builds S-expressions, reifies continuations, and modifies its own control flow — compiles to a single native binary via `psi_transpile.py --target rust`. The compiled tower produces identical output to the interpreted tower in 2.2 ms (vs ~43 s interpreted), a ~20,000x speedup. The 256-byte Cayley table is embedded in the binary and verified at runtime. A compile-time symbol table maps each quoted symbol to a stable integer constant, matching the interpreter's `_symbol_to_term` encoding. See [`docs/transpiler_gaps.md`](docs/transpiler_gaps.md) for the implementation details.

## Why It Matters

The contribution is not "a small table implements Lisp." It is the **independence structure**: self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are three distinct capabilities, each requiring its own irreducible axiom, and nobody has separated them before.

Self-simulation (computing your own table) requires only a retraction pair. Self-description (having coherent roles — judgment distinct from computation) additionally requires the Kripke dichotomy. Self-hosting (running the simulation without an external evaluator) additionally requires composition and substrate. Each boundary is inhabited by a concrete counterexample: a non-dichotomic retraction magma self-simulates but has no clean roles; a dichotomic retract magma without composition has roles but needs an external machine. The Ψ₁₆ᶠ table is all three at once.

This matters because every reflective system — every runtime with a reflection API, every JIT compiler, every meta-circular evaluator — combines these three capabilities without distinguishing them. The Ψ framework separates them and shows what each one costs: a retraction pair (standard category theory), the Kripke wall (one architectural axiom), and machine internalization (two operational axioms). Full analysis: [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md), [`docs/self_simulation_necessity.md`](docs/self_simulation_necessity.md).

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Did you just encode Lisp in a lookup table?** No. A lookup table stores data; this table *computes*. The seven roles (quote, eval, cons, car, cdr, cond, nil) are not encoded — they emerge from axiom interaction. Nobody axiomatized "there must be a pair constructor." The pair structure falls out of the interaction between branching and substrate. The non-circular evidence: five independent formalizations of self-description (phenomenological, information-theoretic, category-theoretic, game-theoretic, self-simulation) all produce the same three categories and the same walls. The roles are consequences, not inputs.

**Are the axioms natural or engineered?** The retraction pair and extensionality are standard category theory. The Kripke dichotomy is one new property — and it is exactly the property that separates self-simulation from self-description (proved independent by counterexample). The machine axioms (compose, inert) are the most "engineered" — they are the conscious choice to internalize the evaluator. But they are also the most clearly justified: without them, you need an external machine, and Smith's tower doesn't terminate. The distinctness axiom (all role-bearing elements are different) is standard algebraic practice, independently justified by expressiveness analysis (49 vs 16 one-step compositions).

**What's the contribution?** Three things. (1) The three-level independence result: self-simulation, self-description, and self-hosting are separable, with concrete counterexamples at each boundary. (2) Machine-checked proofs: 23 universal algebraic theorems (zero `decide`, zero `sorry`) from two independent sources — Kripke axioms and self-simulation. (3) A working artifact: a compiled reflective tower (2.2 ms native) where a program verifies its own algebraic substrate, reifies its continuation, and rewrites its own control flow.

## The Seven Roles

| Ψ | Lisp | Role | Source |
|---|------|------|--------|
| ⊤ | NIL | Empty / base case | Level 1 (retraction pair) |
| Q | QUOTE | Freeze a term (constructor) | Level 1 (retraction pair) |
| E | EVAL | Unwrap / interpret (destructor) | Level 1 (retraction pair) |
| ρ | COND | Conditional branch | Level 2 (Kripke wall) |
| g | CONS | Build a pair | Level 3 (machine: substrate) |
| f | CAR | First projection | Level 2 (Branch axiom) |
| η | CDR | Second projection | Level 3 (machine: Compose) |

The correspondence is structural (same role inventory) rather than semantic (the domains differ: Ψ operates on magma elements, Lisp on symbolic lists). Level 1 gives quote/eval. Level 2 gives the wall that separates judgment from transformation, enabling conditional dispatch. Level 3 gives composition and substrate, enabling pair construction and sequential evaluation. The roles fall out of the levels.

The structure is necessarily non-commutative: any magma with two distinct left-absorbers cannot be commutative (three-line Lean proof in [`NoCommutativity.lean`](DistinctionStructures/NoCommutativity.lean)).

The canonicity lies in the theory, not any model: every finite dichotomic retract magma decomposes into the same three classes with the same hard walls (112 non-isomorphic models at N=4 all share the decomposition). Of the 45 pairwise distinctness requirements among the ten role-bearing elements, **35 are derived theorems** (32 from categorical axioms + 3 from Turing completeness). The remaining **10 are the nontriviality axiom** — as 0 ≠ 1 in a nontrivial ring. Full analysis: [`docs/forced_roles_theorem.md`](docs/forced_roles_theorem.md). Canonicity: [`docs/categorical_canonicity.md`](docs/categorical_canonicity.md).

## Key Results

### Universal Theorems

Proved for ALL finite magmas satisfying the relevant axioms — not just one table. Pure algebraic proofs, no `decide`, no `sorry`. Two independent sources:

**From axioms** ([`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`](DistinctionStructures/CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean), [`NoCommutativity.lean`](DistinctionStructures/NoCommutativity.lean)) — assume Kripke axioms, derive consequences:

- Three-category decomposition: every element is a zero morphism, classifier, or non-classifier `[Lean, universal]`
- Kripke wall: classifier class and non-classifier class are disjoint `[Lean, universal]`
- No right identity in any model `[Lean, universal]`
- Card ≥ 4, tight; card ≥ 5 when sec ≠ ret, tight `[Lean, universal]`
- Retraction pair members are non-classifiers `[Lean, universal]`
- Asymmetry: no commutative magma admits two distinct left-absorbers `[Lean, universal]`

**From definition** ([`SelfSimulation.lean`](DistinctionStructures/SelfSimulation.lean)) — assume self-simulation, derive structural requirements:

- Partial application injectivity: the map a ↦ eval(App(t, rep(a))) must be injective — the self-simulator cannot compress the encoding `[Lean, universal]`
- Partial application distinctness: distinct elements produce distinct intermediate terms `[Lean, universal]`
- Encoding injectivity: self-simulation forces Q-depth encoding to be injective `[Lean, universal]`
- Row determination: equal partial applications imply identical rows `[Lean, universal]`

23 universal theorems across 3 proof files, zero `decide`, zero `sorry`.

### Model-Specific Theorems (Ψ₁₆ᶠ Witness)

Proved for the specific 16-element table by `decide`/`native_decide`.

- Rigidity: every injective endomorphism is the identity `[Lean]`
- Discoverability: 4 probes identify all 16 elements `[Lean]`
- Actuality irreducibility: twin models agree on structure, disagree on classifier assignment `[Lean]`

  **What actuality irreducibility means.** Two Cayley tables can agree on every cell except the classifier's response to one element. Both satisfy all structural axioms. Both are valid models. But they disagree on judgment — one classifies a given element as "true," the other classifies it as "false."

  The theorem says: structure does not determine classification. Three ways to read this:

  - *Philosophically*: the table's structure is phenomenal; the classifier assignment is noumenal. What counts as "actual" is not recoverable from observed structure.
  - *Computationally*: a well-typed program can produce different runtime behavior depending on which twin model it runs on. The type system underdetermines execution.
  - *Informationally*: the table is a channel; the classifier is a message. The channel doesn't determine the message. Additional information is irreducible.

  The classifier isn't arbitrary — both twins satisfy the axioms. It's *independent*: not derivable from anything else in the structure.

- 35/45 role pairs forced distinct: 32 by categorical axioms + 3 by TC `[Lean + Empirical]`
- 83 operational theorems on the 16×16 table `[Lean]`

### SAT and Empirical Results

- Kripke wall: judgment cannot merge with any other role (τ: 9/9 UNSAT) `[SAT]`
- Substrate wall: inert cannot merge with any other role (g: 9/9 UNSAT) `[SAT]`
- TC forces 3 distinctions: Q≠E (lazy/eager), Q≠f (lazy/eager), f≠η (projection uniqueness) `[Empirical]`
- Reflective tower forces 0 additional distinctions: all 10 nontriviality pairs survive full tower `[Empirical]`
- Composition closure forces 0 additional distinctions: all 10 survive sub-magma requirement `[Empirical]`
- 10/45 distinctness pairs are irreducible nontriviality axiom, exhaustively characterized `[Empirical]`
- Turing completeness: 7 axiom-forced elements simulate 2CM `[Empirical]`
- Reflective tower: 3 levels, branch swap, grounded continuations `[Empirical]`
- Compilation: within 4x of native Rust via supercompile → C/Rust; compiled reflective tower in 2.2 ms (20,000x over interpreted) `[Empirical]`
- Compiled reflective tower: meta-circular evaluator + continuation reification + branch swap in a single native binary `[Empirical]`
- GC: 10M allocations in 4MB via MMTk `[Empirical]`
- Futamura: all 3 projections demonstrated, fixed-point verified `[Empirical]`
- Extension profiles: Ψ₁₆ᶠ (hardware) and Ψ₁₆ᶜ (software), same core theorems `[Empirical]`
- Self-simulation: universal self-simulator verified on both Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ (512/512 cells, same code) `[Empirical]`
- Self-simulation: role-aware self-simulator computes 60/256 cells from algebraic rules alone `[Empirical]`
- Kripke dichotomy independent of self-simulation: N=8 non-dichotomic retraction magma self-simulates (64/64 cells) `[SAT + Empirical]`
- Machine boundary: composition and substrate are independent of self-simulation — SAT counterexamples exist `[Empirical + Argument]`

## The Axiom System

What is the simplest finite structure that can identify its own components through its own operation?

The Ψ framework answers this by stacking axioms on a finite magma (N-element set with binary operation `dot`). Each axiom forces a specific capability — absorbers for boundaries, testers for judgment, encoders for synthesis, quote/eval for reflection, branching for control flow — until the structure is self-describing.

**Structural Ladder (L0–L8)** — forces the basic role architecture:

| Level | Name | What It Forces |
|-------|------|----------------|
| L0 | Absorber ⊤ | `∀x: 0·x = 0` |
| L1 | Absorber ⊥ | `∀x: 1·x = 1` |
| L2 | Extensionality | All rows distinct |
| L3 | Tester exists | At least one non-absorber has boolean outputs |
| L4 | Encoder exists | At least one element synthesizes (≥2 distinct non-boolean outputs) |
| L5 | No extra absorbers | Only ⊤ and ⊥ are absorbers |
| L6 | No extra testers | At most 2 testers among non-absorbers |
| L7 | Inert exists | At least one "substrate" element |
| L8 | Encoder separation | ≥2 encoders with distinct output sets |

**Operational Axioms** — force specific computational capabilities:

| Axiom | What It Forces |
|-------|----------------|
| **C (Kripke)** | Only testers can produce boolean outputs on non-absorbers |
| **D (Inert Propagation)** | Inert elements preserve non-absorber status |
| **PA (Power-Associativity)** | `(x·x)·x = x·(x·x)` for all x |
| **VV (Inert Self-Application)** | Inert self-application yields a tester or encoder |
| **QE (Quote/Eval)** | `E·(Q·x) = x` and `Q·(E·x) = x` on core — mutual inverses |
| **1-Inert** | Exactly 1 inert element |
| **E-Transparency** | `E·⊤ = ⊤` and `E·⊥ = ⊥` |
| **Branch** | `ρ·x = f·x` if `τ·x = ⊤`, else `ρ·x = g·x` — tester-mediated conditional |
| **Compose** | `η·x = ρ·(g·x)` — function composition through branch |
| **Y-Combinator** | `Y·ρ = ρ·(Y·ρ)`, with `Y·ρ ≥ 2` — fixed-point combinator |
| **Selection** | `η·ρ = τ` — composing then branching yields a judgment |

| Feature | Min N |
|---------|-------|
| L8 (full ladder) | 6 |
| + QE pair | 8 |
| + Branch/Compose/Y | 12 |
| + IO + 8-state counter + Selection | 16 |

The axiom stack admits models of size 12 supporting quote/eval, branching, and fixed points — enough for Turing completeness. The specific model Ψ₁₆ᶠ adds efficient counters, IO, product encodings, and a Y-combinator at size 16. The computational core is 7 axiom-forced elements; the rest is infrastructure. Full details: [`docs/technical_overview.md`](docs/technical_overview.md).

The axioms have an equivalent categorical formulation using standard vocabulary: zero morphisms, retraction pairs, subobject classifiers, and the Kripke dichotomy. The categorical formulation and its universal theorems are in [`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`](DistinctionStructures/CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean) (minimal 5-element witness + 16 universal algebraic theorems), [`NoCommutativity.lean`](DistinctionStructures/NoCommutativity.lean) (asymmetry — 3 universal theorems), and [`CategoricalFoundation.lean`](DistinctionStructures/CategoricalFoundation.lean) (full 16-element structure with products, copairing, and fixed-point combinator). All use only standard algebraic concepts — no Ψ-specific vocabulary.

The axioms correspond to the three levels: the retraction pair (level 1) enables self-simulation, the Kripke dichotomy (level 2) creates clean roles, and compose + inert (level 3) internalize the evaluator. Full inevitability analysis: [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md).

Results fall into four tiers:

- **Universal results** — properties proved for *every* model satisfying the axiom class. Tagged `[Lean]` or `[SAT]`.
- **Model-specific results** — properties proved for the particular table Ψ₁₆ᶠ. Tagged `[Lean]`.
- **Empirical search results** — SAT satisfiability, minimality bounds, freedom analysis, recovery observations. Tagged `[SAT]` or `[Empirical]`.
- **Open claims** — not yet formalized. Tagged `[Open]`.

## What Is Not Proved

- **Uniqueness of Ψ₁₆ᶠ.** The Cayley table is one model from the solution space. The axioms constrain roles and relationships but leave 192/256 cells free at N=16 (25.0% determination). Cell-by-cell freedom analysis (`ds_search/n16_freedom.py`) confirms: absorber rows fully fixed (32), counter/INC/DEC pinned (24), E-transparency + INC2 fix 6 E-cells, selection fixes η·ρ, Y fixed-point fixes Y·ρ. Scale: N=8 → 28.1%, N=12 → 18.8%, N=16 → 25.0% (increase from N=12 due to additional operational constraints).
- **Minimality from base axioms.** Abstract axiom limitation theorems show base DirectedDS axioms imply only `card ≥ 2` (tight). What forcing conditions derive the full structure from first principles remains open.
- **Self-modeling vs discriminability.** Empirical search shows nearly all rigid magmas are WL-1 discriminable without self-modeling — unique structural fingerprints suffice for identification. Self-modeling adds interpretability: elements don't just have unique fingerprints, they have roles (classifier, transformer, substrate) that make the algebra a computational system rather than a mere barcode. Whether interpretability is necessary for reflective computation, or merely convenient, is open.
- **Extension profile optimality.** Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ are two points in the extension design space. Whether either is optimal for its target — or whether better profiles exist — is unexplored. The methodology (SAT search with target-specific constraints) can find other profiles, but the space has not been systematically enumerated.
- **Distinctness: 78% derived, 22% axiomatic (fully characterized).** Of 45 pairwise distinctness requirements, 35 are derived: 32 from categorical axioms (Lean-proved on the witness, SAT-verified universally at N=12) and 3 from Turing completeness (lazy/eager and projection conflicts — no evaluator can resolve them). The remaining 10 (⊤=⊥, Q=ρ, Q=Y, E=f, E=ρ, E=Y, f=ρ, f=Y, ρ=Y, η=Y) have been exhaustively tested against categorical axioms, Turing completeness, composition closure, and the full reflective tower including continuation reification and branch swap. All 10 survive all tests. They are the nontriviality axiom — the analog of 0 ≠ 1 in a nontrivial ring. Merged-role algebras satisfying all other axioms exist, compute, and reflect; they are expressively but not computationally degenerate.
- **Self-simulation derivation (resolved).** Self-simulation (one program computes the Cayley table) forces partial application injectivity (Lean-proved) and is sufficient for any model satisfying the axioms (verified on both Ψ₁₆ᶠ and Ψ₁₆ᶜ). The **Kripke dichotomy is independent**: a concrete N=8 non-dichotomic retraction magma with mixed elements (rows having both boolean and non-boolean outputs on the core) self-simulates perfectly — 64/64 cells correct. The universal self-simulator never classifies outputs by type; it decodes Q-depth and looks up the table. The Kripke wall is not about computing the table — it is the architectural choice that organizes the algebra into coherent roles (classifiers vs transformers), lifting self-simulation into self-*description*. Compose and inert are also independent (SAT counterexamples). See [`docs/self_simulation_necessity.md`](docs/self_simulation_necessity.md).
- **No canonical object.** Ψ₁₆ᶠ is not initial, terminal, or otherwise universal in the category of Kripke magmas — 112 non-isomorphic models exist at N=4, and no homomorphisms exist from the minimal witnesses to Ψ₁₆ᶠ. The canonicity of the project's results lies at the theory level (the three-class decomposition is a functorial invariant shared by all models) rather than the object level. Whether a natural universal property characterizes Ψ₁₆ᶠ within the subvariety DRMag⁺ (with products, copairing, fixed points, and distinctness) remains open. See [`docs/categorical_canonicity.md`](docs/categorical_canonicity.md).
- **Categorical formalization (partially complete).** The Kripke wall layer is now Lean-formalized: `CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean` defines the minimal `DichotomicRetractMagma` structure (zero morphisms, retraction pair, Kripke dichotomy) and proves 16 universal theorems purely algebraically; `NoCommutativity.lean` adds 3 more (asymmetry). The full three-layer inevitability argument (categorical → distinctness → Ψ-specific) has Lean support for the categorical layer (Kripke wall, three-category decomposition, non-classifier membership, asymmetry) and the model-specific layer (rigidity, discoverability, forced distinctness on the 16-element witness). The intermediate distinctness layer — proving that the 13 non-forced pairs are independently justified by expressiveness — remains supported by SAT analysis, not Lean. See [`docs/inevitability_summary.md`](docs/inevitability_summary.md).

## Related Work

Boba's Tower sits at one end of an architectural fork in reflective language design.

Smith's 3-Lisp (1984) introduced the reflective tower — an infinite chain of meta-interpreters, each interpreting the one below. Subsequent implementations (Black, Brown, Blond) added live meta-modification: `(set! base-eval ...)` changes how the running interpreter works. Amin and Rompf (POPL 2018) showed how to compile user programs *through* the tower via stage polymorphism, collapsing multiple interpretation levels into efficient generated code.

All of these systems use higher-order continuations — opaque closures that can be invoked and composed but not inspected. Boba's Tower uses defunctionalized continuations — tagged data structures that can be walked, inspected frame by frame, and modified field by field. This is the architectural fork, and it is forced by whether the tower terminates.

An infinite tower cannot be defunctionalized — there are infinitely many continuation types. A grounded tower must be — there is no closure to hide behind; the bottom is data. Therefore: grounded → finite continuation types → defunctionalization → transparency → the branch swap. And symmetrically: infinite → closures → opacity → live meta-modification. The transparency of our continuations and the opacity of theirs are consequences of the same design choice.

| System | Tower | Continuations | Headline result |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Smith (1984) | Infinite | — | Reflective tower concept |
| Black/Brown/Blond | Infinite | Opaque closures | Live `set! base-eval` |
| Amin & Rompf (POPL 2018) | Collapsible | Opaque closures | Compile through the tower |
| **Boba's Tower (Kamea)** | **Grounded (256 bytes)** | **Tagged data** | **Compile the tower itself** |

What they have that we don't: live meta-interpreter modification (`set! base-eval`), infinite tower levels, compilation under modified semantics. What we have that none of them do: walkable continuations (the branch swap), a compiled tower (2.2 ms native), formal verification (106+ Lean theorems, zero `sorry`), and runtime substrate verification. See [`docs/related_work.md`](docs/related_work.md) for the full comparison.

## Performance

Two benchmarks: counter arithmetic (fib + fact + power + gcd, all inputs known at call time) and N-Queens(8) (backtracking search with cons-cell lists, 92 solutions). Counter arithmetic is pure compute; nqueens stresses allocation and recursion.

**Counter arithmetic** (fib(8) + fib-iter(30) + fact(10) + power(2,10) + gcd(100,75), amortized per iteration):

| Implementation | Time/iter | vs Native Rust |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Native Rust** (LLVM -O) | 0.003 µs | 1x |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → C** (gcc -O2) | 0.01 µs | **~4x** |
| **Native Python** | 5 µs | ~1,700x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Rust interpreter)** | ~200 ms | ~70,000,000x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | ~2,000 ms | ~700,000,000x |

**N-Queens(8)** (backtracking with cons/car/cdr, per call):

| Implementation | Time/call | vs Native Rust |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Native Rust** (LLVM -O) | 47 µs | 1x |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → C** (gcc -O2) | 86 µs | **1.8x** |
| **Compiled Ψ-Lisp → Rust** (LLVM -O) | 114 µs | **2.4x** |
| **Native Python** | 5.9 ms | 125x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Rust interpreter)** | 4.1 s | 87,000x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | 301 s | 6,400,000x |

Compiled Ψ-Lisp is within **4x of native Rust** on pure arithmetic and within **2x on nqueens(8)** — faster than native Python in both cases. The nqueens gap is smaller because the cons-cell arena (bump allocator, no GC) is competitive with Rust's `Vec` push/pop. The entire compilation pipeline is ~1,100 lines: a 312-line supercompiler, a 640-line transpiler, and a 121-line C runtime whose core is a 256-byte array. Full performance analysis and extension profile comparison: [`docs/technical_overview.md#10-performance`](docs/technical_overview.md#10-performance).

**Boba's Tower** (meta-circular evaluator: fib(8) + fact(10) + table verification + reify/reflect + branch swap):

| Implementation | Time | vs Compiled |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| **Compiled tower** (rustc -O) | 2.2 ms | 1x |
| **Ψ-Lisp (Python interpreter)** | ~43 s | ~20,000x |

The compiled tower is not about benchmark speed — it's about having the meta-circular evaluator as compiled Rust with continuations as data, the Cayley table verified at runtime, and branch swap via continuation modification, all in a single native binary.

## Building

`lake build` compiles all Lean files — the categorical foundation (19 universal theorems from axioms in `CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean` + `NoCommutativity.lean`), the self-simulation foundation (4 universal theorems from definition in `SelfSimulation.lean`), and the Ψ-specific operational proofs (130+ theorems on the 16-element table in `Psi16*.lean`). Zero `decide` on universal theorems. Zero `sorry` across all files.

# → open http://localhost:8080
```

Lean proofs use two techniques: universal theorems (`CatKripkeWallMinimal.lean`, `PsiUniversalBounds.lean`) use pure algebraic reasoning — no `decide`, no `native_decide`. Model-specific theorems (`Psi16*.lean`, `Cat*.lean`) use `decide` or `native_decide`, appropriate and complete for finite carrier types with decidable equality. Zero `sorry` across all files.

All Mini-Lisp test programs produce identical output across Python, compiled C, compiled Rust, Rust interpreter, and WASM.
