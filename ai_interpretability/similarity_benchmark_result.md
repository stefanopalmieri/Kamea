We tested six representation-based interpretability methods (K-Means, spectral clustering, similarity-profile K-Means, linear probes, activation patching, behavioral feature probes) across two training regimes (baseline, L_role-regularized) on networks learning Δ₁ and a control algebra. No representation-based method exceeded ARI=0.38 on Δ₁ under any condition. DS Recovery achieved ARI=1.000 under all conditions. Discoverability regularization, despite driving representational-behavioral similarity correlation to 1.000, did not improve any representation-based method and degraded most. We conclude that algebraic role structure is a behavioral property — defined by the pattern of outputs across all possible inputs — that is not recoverable from individual activation vectors or their pairwise similarities. Behavioral probing, which queries the function systematically, accesses information that representation analysis cannot, regardless of how representations are organized. This result suggests that the gap between behavioral and representational interpretability is not a limitation of current methods but a fundamental difference in the information available at each level of analysis.

The gap between generic behavioral clustering (ARI=0.32) and framework-guided behavioral probing (ARI=1.00) on identical input data quantifies the value of algebraic structure in semantic recovery, and motivates the development of lightweight behavioral typing methods that approximate the recovery procedure's algebraic predicates without requiring domain-specific axioms.
